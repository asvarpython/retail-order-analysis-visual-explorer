# Retail Order Analysis Visual Explorer 📊

Welcome to the **Retail Order Analysis Visual Explorer** project! This interactive web application is designed to help users explore, analyze, and visualize retail order data through an intuitive interface. The application integrates with a MySQL database to allow detailed data exploration and actionable insights for business analysis.

---

## Project Overview 🚀

This project includes several key components for processing and visualizing retail order data:

### Data Acquisition 📥
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle. You can view and download it from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitbansal06/retail-orders).

### Data Cleaning and Transformation 🔧
- **Cleaned Data**: Handled missing values, inconsistencies, and transformed the dataset into two main DataFrames:
  - `order_details`: Contains order-related information like order ID, customer ID, order date, and amount.
  - `product_details`: Contains product-related information like product ID, name, category, and price.

### Database Integration 🗄️
- **MySQL Database**: Set up a MySQL database and populated it with cleaned data from the two DataFrames.

### Data Exploration and Analysis 🔍
- Developed a **Jupyter Notebook** to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), including visualizations and summary statistics.
- Formulated and executed **20+ SQL queries** to answer key business questions.

### Web Application Development 🌐
- Built an interactive **Streamlit** application.
- Integrated the app with the MySQL database and included interactive **Plotly Express visualizations**.
- Enabled users to explore data with customizable filters.

    conda env create -f roave.yml
    ```
2. **Activate the newly created environment:**:
    ```bash
    conda activate roave
    ```

### Configure Streamlit Secrets 🔑
Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in your project directory and add your database credentials:
```toml
[db_config]
server = "your_mysql_host"
database = "retail_orders"
username = "your_mysql_username"
password = "your_mysql_password"
port = "3306"
[sql]
script = "your_mysql_query_file_path"
```

### Prepare Data 💾
1. **Create a MySQL Database** and import the retail order data into it.
2. **Explore Data**: Open the provided Jupyter notebook for an interactive exploration.

### Run the Streamlit Application 🎬
